#HELPS
0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~
33 AASSIGN~
Syntax: aassign <filename>.are  Example:  aassign edo.are

AASSIGN temporarily assigns all rooms, objects, and mobiles in the area
range to your pfile.  This allows you to use rlist, olist, mlist, and
reset list.  This also means that typing savearea, reset area, or
instazone will affect this area.

To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.

&rWarning&w!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.

In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you by a Greater God or higher.

In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by an Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed
only Lesser+ can aassign themselves nonproto areas.

40 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~
32 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction, as well as
the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.

If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one, use
a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
  redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001

To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to refer to
it by number:
  redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
  (to know what number an exit is, do an "rstat")

For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one of
the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It's also usually a good idea
to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer to those
with autoexits on.

The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
  redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
  redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
  redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
  ... here, if a player types 'swim' in the room they will move to room 3001

~
1 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
Syntax:  affected       (abbrevation:  af)
Syntax:  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)

'Affected' is a spells-at-a-glance function, which displays only the spells
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <spell/skill name> or 'score').

Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash.

'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its spell/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.

'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.
~
31 AFFECTEDBY AFFECTED_BY~
The following are affect flags that can be used when osetting an item
(with oset <item> affect affected <affect flag>).  These flags can also
be used when msetting a mobile (mset <mob name> affected <affect flag>).
They may additionally be used to mset players if your level allows it.

Blind          Invisible    Detect_evil  Detect_invis  Detect_magic
Detect_hidden  **Hold**     Sanctuary    Faerie_fire   Infrared
Curse          **Flaming**  Poison       Protect       Paralysis
Sneak          Hide         Sleep        Charm         Flying
Pass_door      Floating     Truesight    Detect_traps  Scrying
Fireshield     Shockshield  Iceshield    Aqua_breath   Possess

Note - Hold and Flaming are current not in use.

~
0 AFK~
Syntax:  afk (abbreviation for "away from keyboard")

The 'afk' command will place an [AFK] flag beside your name on the who
list when activated, as well as informing those who send tells that you
you are afk.  It can be toggled on or off by typing afk, and will also
go off automatically when you enter any command.

~
1 AGGRESSIVE~
Syntax: style aggressive

This style of combat allows a fighter to strike more effectively, but
leaves many holes in his defenses as well. Fighters who know this tactic
can strike enemies for more damage, but their enemies' weapons will slip
through their defenses for slightly more damage as well.

See Also: style, evasive, defensive, standard, aggressive, berserk
~
1 ALIAS~
Syntax: alias [New Command Word] [Command(s) It activates]

You can use the alias command to make a shorter or easier command that
replaces a longer or more in depth on. (This only applys to the character
who made the alias) An example would be:
alias nc note write
Typing nc would do "note write"

Alias alone gives you a list of the aliases you have made and you may
not use an alias to overwrite anouther command for instance:
alias nw note write

This would go through fine but "nw" would still take you northwest.
~
32 ALIGNMENT ALIGN ZAPPING~
Your alignment can range from +300 to -300. When you are +300 this
means that you are good aligned, when you are -300 this means you are
evil aligned, and when you are 0 aligned this means you are neutral.
You can change your alignment by killing good or evil aligned mobs.
This will raise or lower your alignment.

The different alignments will allow you to wear different pieces of
equipment. If you are good aligned and try to wear a piece of equipment
which is antigood, you will be zapped, which means the piece of eq will
fall to the ground. The same occurs when you are evil and you try to
wear an antievil piece of eq, or if you are neutral and try to wear
an antineutral piece of eq. You can also be zapped during battle if you
are fighting a mob opposite of your align.

You can find out what your alignment is by typing SCORE.
~
38 ALLOW BAN~
ALLOW BAN WARN
Syntax:  allow  site/race/class    <address/race/class>
Syntax:  ban    site/race/class    <address/race/class>   <type>    <duration>
Syntax:  ban    show               <class/site/race>      <number>
Syntax:  warn   <site/class/race>  <number>

BAN site will ban a site from playing the game.
BAN race bans anyone with that race from playing the game.
BAN class bans anyone with that class from playing the game.
BAN site/race/class without any other arguemts will give you a list of
currently banned sites/races/classes.
Type can either be a level or one of the following keywords: all,newbie,mortal,
warn. If you set it to a level everyone equal to that level and below will not
be allowed on.  Warn, sends a warning to the Warn: channel that someone if
logging in from the site, with a certaing class or race.  If you add the
duration, the ban will expire in that many days. Sites can be banned with the *
wildcard as well.  Be carefull however as *.edu would ban everysite from .edu,
or *foo* would ban anysite that had the string foo in it.
BAN show, will print out the reason why that particular site/race or class was
banned and by who.  Number can be a class or race name, a site address or
you can use # followed by the ban number.
WARN will toggle the warn flag on a CURRENTLY banned site/class or race.

ALLOW site/race/class  <address/race/class>  removes a site, class or race from
the ban list.  This also can be allowed by using # syntax.

~
0 ANSI~
Syntax: ansi <on/off>

The ansi command will either enable or disable ansi colour.  Ansi colour
will work provided your terminal has a compatible mode.
~
0 APPRAISE~
Syntax: appraise <item>
        appraise all

Appraise, when at a repairshop type mob, will tell you the condition of
your equipment in question.  The mob will tell you if it needs repair or
not, and if so, how much it will cost.

~
1 AREAS~
Syntax:  areas
Syntax:  areas old
Syntax:  areas <low range> <hi range>

The 'areas' command displays an alphabetically sorted list of all areas
within the game, together with the author and suggested level range of
each area.

The 'areas old' command displays an unsorted list of all areas (the old
style), as well as the author and suggested level range of each area.

You can specify a level range to see a list of all areas with suggested
ranges which encompass the argument.  This can be a little awkward as
each area has a low and a high suggested range.  Suffice to say that if
an area's level range matches even one level of the range you request,
it will be displayed.

Special thanks to Fireblade for design and coding of this restyled function.
The Realms of Despair will provide a copy of areas built by individuals
to that individual and no one else. To receive a copy of an area for use
on other muds, you must contact that individual.

~
32 ARMORCLASS~
.
&gThere are two values used with armor class for object type Armor:

&GValue0: Variable amount based on level of item at repop.
Value1: Maximum repairable armor setting for the object.

&gSetting Value0 has no effect. It will re-adjust itself on repop based on
the repop level of the item. Setting Value1 below the expected repop value
for Value0 will result in an item that cannot be repaired until Value0 drops
below Value1's setting. The listing below gives you a rough approximation of
the values returned for Value0 based on level:

&GLevel Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0
-------------   ------   -------------   ------   -------------   ------
      1           1-3         10           3-5         20           6-8
     30           8-10        40          11-13        30          13-15

&gThe amount that Value0 is set to determines the amount the player's A.C. will
be adjusted. Different wear locations have a different multiplying affect:

&G0 X Value0: Wield, Ears.
1 X Value0: Arms,  Finger, Neck, Feet, Hands, Shield, Waist, Wrist, Hold, Eyes.
2 X Value0: Head,  Legs,   About.
3 X Value0: Body.

~
2 ATTACKER ATTACKERFLAG ATTACKERFLAGS~
&PAttacker &Wflags are automatically given by the mud code to players
who engage in illegal attacks upon other players. These attacks can
initiated by using MURDER, casting an attack spell, or ordering
followers to attack a player. Deadlies attacking Deadlies do not
receive Attacker Flags. These flags are only given out in situations
that involve Peaceful players, i.e. Deadlies attacking Peacefuls,
(or vice versa), or Peacefuls attacking Peacefuls. You will be
tagged with an &PAttacker &Wflag if:

  1. You attempt to MURDER another player, or they attempt to
  MURDER you. (See &CHelp Murder &Wand &GLaws Pkill &Wfor more info
  on attacking other players).

  2. You order charmed mobiles or pets to attack a player, or you
  are attacked by another players mobiles. (See &CHelp Charm &Wor
  &CHelp Pets &Wfor more info)>

  3. You are a &RDeadly &Wplayer and attacked a fellow Clanmember.

&WDarkhaven Guards, shopkeepers and special function mobs now respond
differently to illegal flags. You may find yourself barred from making
purchases, placed before Judge Kendra for a hearing, or sentenced to
jail. Should you acquire an &PAttacker &Wor any other illegal activity
flag, see Judge Kendra in Townhall. Her Honour is located one west of
the Main Lobby (See &CHelp Townhall &Wfor info).

33 ATTACKS~
This item is no longer used. See Help specfun to apply skill groups to a
monster


See MSET and DEFENSES  (Some are not implemented).
~
1 AUCTION~
Syntax: auction <item name> <starting value>
Syntax: auction bid <value>

The auction command is used for performing auctions.  Simply typing auction
will display the current item being auctioned, if there is one. If nothing is
being auctioned, auction <item name> <starting value> will begin an auction.
If no starting value is specified, it begins at 0 gold.

Auction bid <value> will place a bet for the item.
Auction will also work with the following arguments:

au bid 20k      - bids 20000 coins
au bid 20k300   - bids 20300 coins (20,000 + 300)
au bid 20k3003  - bids 20300 coins, too (only checks first 3 chars after "k")
au bid 1m       - bids 1 million coins

On an existing bid of 3000:
au bid +10       - adds 10%, making the bet 1300.
au bid +         - adds 25% (the default if no number given), bet is 12300.
au bid x         - multiplies by 2, making the bet 20000.
au bid x5        - multiplies by 5, making the bet 30000.
~
31 AUCTIONSTOP~
Syntax <auctionstop>

Auction stop will stop the current auction. use it with discression, do not
stop an auction just because of an over bid. The only real reason to stop an
auction would be becuase of a broken item, scammed or stolen item.
~
31 AVTALK~
Syntax: avtalk <message>

This allows you to use the avtalk (level 30+) channel.
~
1 AXE~
&wThis is a passive skill that allows you to use an axe.
It's use is automatic once you have learned it.
~
31 BAMFIN BAMFOUT~
Syntax: bamfin  <message>
Syntax: bamfout <message>

The standard messages for GOTO are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the BAMFIN and BAMFOUT commands.
~
31 'BAN 30'~
Seeking to ban a site above level 1 should be an extremely rare situation. One
in which the actions of one or more key persons from a site are deemed to be
a detriment to the enjoyment of a large portion of the players in the game.
Such person(s) are generally deemed to be beyond rehabilitation at this time.

When seeking to ban a site, make use of the Grub command to both see the impact
of the ban, and to get a list of all character names from the site. You can use
this list to keep an eye out for these characters coming in from other sites,
as it's obvious these days that a site ban may not always cure the situation.

All site bans above level one should be set at level 30 or higher. It should be
a rare instance in which a site is banned at some in between level. Only in the
direst of instances would a site be banned above level 30, as this will affect
immortal level players as well.

See also: 'BAN ALLOW' 'BAN NEWBIE' 'BAN DURATION'
~
31 'BAN DURATION'~
The standard set for ban durations are as follows:

Newbie Ban:          1) One week on first instance.
                     2) Two weeks for the second.
                     3) One month at newbie, or level 30 for third.
                     4) Permanent at newbie, or level 30 for 4th offense.

Bans for level 2-30: 1) One month for first instance.
                     2) Two months, or permanent for 2nd.
                     3) Permanent for 3rd offense.

All bans above level 30 should be permanent by their very nature.

&WReminder - Without documenting each time we ban a site, we will have no
           source of history on sites. Always remember to post a note
           detailing the reasons for the ban.&w

See also: 'BAN ALLOW' 'BAN NEWBIE' 'BAN 30'
~
31 'BAN NEWBIE'~
Banning a site is a form of last resort, as it not only affects the offending
player or players, but will also affect every other player from that site.
Before seeking to ban a site, even for a temporary level 1 banning, make
sure you have exhausted all other options first.

In the case of newbie bans, most such instances arise through the actions of
one or more abusive players who log in a newbie and begin swearing, spamming,
threatening, etc.. Many times this has developed from an immature player's
frustrations over getting a name authed. If you find a player going through a
series of silly names trying to auth them, make every effort to try and talk
with them first. If this fails, use Fquit to discourage them. If you have
Disconnect, use this instead, as it is less provoking than fquit (makes it
appear as if they simply lost their conneection). If they continue their
efforts, send them warnings to get their attention. Use freeze if you have it
(or if someone else is on who can use it) to get their attention and make sure
received the message. Then, and only then, once you've exhausted all avenues
at being civil, you can use ban in good conscience. You've given the player(s)
every chance to cease their actions and given them fair warning over the fact
that if they continue they risk getting banned.

1 BANK WITHDRAW DEPOSIT BALANCE~
0 BANK BALANCE DEPOSIT WITHDRAW
Syntax:  balance
Syntax:  deposit <amount>
Syntax:  withdraw <amount>

The banking commands allow you to manage your funds more effeciently.
Funds deposited in banks are safe from thieves, and are saved even if
you die, so storing some cash in the bank is a wise precaution.

To DEPOSIT, simply find a bank, and deposit any amount of gold you wish.

To WITHDRAW, simply go to the bank and withdraw what you need.

To see how much you have, type BALANCE, it will show you how much you
have on hand, and how much is in the bank.

Code for banks courtesy of Minas Ravenblood of The Apocalypse Theatre.

~
38 BARENUM BARESIZE~
Syntax: mset <mob> barenum <number>
mset <mob> baresize <num>

These mob fields control the mobs ability to fight without weapons.
Barenum is the low end of the damage done and baresize is the multiplier.
For example: barenum 10 and baresize 5 would have the effect of allowing
the mob to hit barehanded for 10-30 damage.

* This field also affects experience gained.
Experience is calculated as follows:
^level 3*5 + max_hit +barenum *baresize +damroll * 30
+hitroll *ch -> level *10
~
40 BESTOW BESTOWMENTS~
Syntax: bestow <victim> command [command] [command] etc
bestow <victim> list
bestow <victim> none

Bestow is used to give a command to a player that the player would not normally
have. Bestow victim command will give the command to the person, bestow victim
list will show all commands corrently bestowed on the person, and bestow victim
none will remove all bestowments.
~
35 BESTOWAREA~
Syntax: bestowarea <victim> <filename>.are

This command allows members of the Area Council to bestow area names
to immortals so that they can engage in group building.

Once an AC member bestows a proto area on a player, that player can
use the aassign command to assign themselves that proto area in order
to help the owner of the proto area.

Examples:

bestowarea joe bob.are           allows joe to work on bob's proto area
bestowarea joe                   lists all of joe's bestowed areas
bestowarea joe list              ditto
bestowarea joe none              removes all of joe's bestowed areas

~
1 BLINDED~
Certain spells and attacks can render a player blind for anywhere from a
few rounds (gouge) to several hundred rounds (the blind spell).  If you
are blinded, you will see only your name on the 'who' list, and will be
unable to see either your inventory or your location.

You may either wait out the effect of the blindness, request assistance
over channels, or make your way to a healer such as Sonoria in Darkhaven,
who will eventually remove your blindness.

QUAFF quaffs a potion (as opposed to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).

RECITE recites a magical scroll; the <target> is optional, depending on the
nature of the scroll.

~
0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

1 CHANNELS~
Syntax:  channels
Syntax:  channels +<channel|all>
Syntax:  channels -<channel|all>

With no options, CHANNELS show you your current channels.  With a plus or
minus sign and an option, CHANNELS turns that channel on or off.  Using the
'all' option, CHANNELS will turn on/off all normal channels.

Public channels are those that can be seen by everyone, regardless of their
affiliation with clans, guilds, orders or councils.  Private channels are
channels available to those with affiliations of some sort, and also tells.

The first channels you will have as a new player are SAY, TELL, and NEWBIE.

 - to use say, the person you want to talk to must be in the same room,
   just type SAY <message>.
 - to use tell, the target person may be anywhere within the Realms, just
   type TELL <name or 0.name> [message].
 - newbiechat is seen and used only by level 1 characters, members of the
   Newbie Council, and Immortals.

Syntax: music    <message>
Syntax: ask      <message>
Syntax: answer   <message>
Syntax: shout    <message>
Syntax: yell     <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

CHAT, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all interested
players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The ASK and ANSWER commands
both use the same 'question' channel

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.
~
38 CHECKVNUM CHECKVNUMS~

31 CLIMATE~
Syntax climate <field> <name>

This command allows you to view or modify the climate
settings for an area. There are settings for temperature,
precipitation, and wind. In addition, you may specify
neighboring areas who will affect changes in the current

~
31 COLORS~
The ability to color Help and other files is very useful. We ask
that you try to stick to these guidelines for color usage so that
we can have some consistency in their use:

Here are some outlines for using color on a white text file:
  &CHelp (Filename) &Wcolored cyan.
  &GLaws (Law) &WColored green.
  &PAttacker/Killer/Thief &Wcolored pink.
  &GOrder/Guild (Order/Guild) &Wcolored green.
  &RClans (Clan) &Wcolored red.
  &YSyntax  &Wfor sytax references, colored yellow.
  &CDeities (Deity) &Wcolored cyan.
  &RDeadly/Dealies &Wcolored red.
&Y  Config (+/- option) &Wcolored yellow.&D

If you wish to add other colors to your file, please use good
taste, make sure it is readable and don't get too whacky. If
you follow the above guidelines and stick to using white for
all other text, it will keep the text solid and legible. Should
you choose not to use any colors at all, that is also okay, the
above guidlines are merely for proper use of color, white is
always acceptable.

In addition, please keep in mind that the following topics should
not be colored except by their defaults:
  - Help (area name)
  - Help (skill)
  - Help (spell)
  - Help (class)
~
1 COMBAT~
You may choose a fight by finding a mob, and using LOOK, CONSIDER, and
IDENTIFY to gauge the difficulty of the opponent.  You can LOOK <mob>
to get a look at its equipment and description, this will often help
indicate how hard a fight might be. You can CONSIDER <mob> for a one
on one comparison of the mobs hitpoints and level to your own.  You may
also CAST IDENTIFY <mob> to get more detailed information about the mob.

You may start a fight by using KILL, MURDER, or many spells and skills
available to players.  The easiest way to start a fight is to KILL <mob>.
Currently, you may also MURDER <mob>, but this causes the mob to yell out.

You may find yourself in trouble during a fight, and wish to leave, this
can be done by using FLEE or RECALL.  You can flee a fight by typing FLEE.
You may recall from a fight with the spell 'word of recall' or by reciting
a recall scroll.  You may also set it up to flee automatically once you go
below a certain number of hitpoints by using WIMPY.  To use your wimpy, type
WIMPY or WIMPY <number of hitpoints>.  Leaving a fight with wimpy, flee, and
recall WILL cost you a loss of experience, with recall causing the greatest
loss.

For more information on combat, read section 12 of your Adventurer's Guide.

1 DAGGER~
&wThis is a passive skill that allows you to use a dagger.
It's use is automatic once you have learned it.
~
0 DAMAGE~
When one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown
in the verb used in the damage message.  Damage messages vary depending
on weapon type, or what is inflicting the damage.  Escalating damage is
indicated by the use of _ _ around the messages, regardless of weapon
type.  Messages in all caps indicate even higher degrees of damage,
while those surrounded by * * indicate the highest levels.

The message shown will reflect the actual damage you are inflicting on
(or receiving from) your opponent, and not a specific fixed amount.
~

31 DAMPLUS~
.
For those unsure of what damplus is, it is part of the damage
equasion for a mob... ie:  10d6 + 10   (the +10 is the damplus)
This "damplus" is always added, whether or not the mob is barehanded or
wielding a weapon.   This is basically the mob's damroll.

~
1 DAMROLL~
Represents the amount of damage you inflict upon an opponent.
The higher the number, the better.

~
0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated at the Altar to Thoric in
Darkhaven (or your clan's temple).  Your corpse is left behind where you
were killed, together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with
you (the gods want you to have your gold).

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death, and you lose
experience points as well.  Following/groups are not affected by death.

Corpses decay after time.  When this happens the objects inside a corpse
will decay with it.  Player corpses last roughly 30 minutes of real time.
Only the player who died or someone in their group can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.  The only exceptions are for deadly characters,
who can loot each other's corpses at will.

If you have chosen a deity and have gained enough favor, you may be able
to supplicate to your god for your corpse.  Also see 'help supplicate',
'help deities', 'help favor' for more information on deities.

For more information on death, see section 13 of your Adventurers Guide.

See MSET and ATTACKS  (Some are not implemented).
~
1 DEFENSIVE~
Syntax: style defensive

This style emphasizes the deflecting of blows from an enemy. It is similar
to the evasive style, except that it focuses on holding ground instead of
dodging. An effective fighter will take less damage from an enemy, but not
as much as one using evasive tactics. A fighter will also do less damage to
enemies, but slightly greater than those who simply evade.

See Also: style, evasive, defensive, standard, aggressive, berserk

~
38 DELAY~
Syntax: delay <victim> <rounds>

This command will allow an immortal to "pause" a player. All commands
received by the mud from that player will be delayed by the number of
round determined by the delaying immortal. After the rounds have
elapsed, anything input by the victim during the delay will take affect
on the mud.
NOTE: Mobiles cannot be delayed.
~

Syntax: deny       <character>
Syntax: disconnect <character>
Syntax: freeze     <character>

DENY denies access to a particular player and throws them out of the game.
DENY persists past reboots and crashes and can only be undone by either loading
up the character and doing a 'mset <character name> flags deny', or by editing
the player file offline.

DISCONNECT <character> immediately disconnects that character.

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all.
~
0 DESCRIPTION BIO~

        bio

The DESCRIPTION command puts you into an editor to edit your long character
description (what people see when they look at you).
The BIO command puts you into an editor to edit your personal bio: what
people see when they check WHOIS on you.

An Immortal can request you change your description or bio if it contains
inappropriate material.  Do not use profanity, racial slurs, sexual comments,
other players names (without their permission), or off-color remarks.  Refusal
to change your bio, description, or title on Immortal request is grounds for
loss of character privileges.
~
45 DESTROY~
-----------------------------------------------------------

     SYNTAX:  destroy <target>

DESCRIPTION: The DESTROY command does exactly as it suggests:
             destroys player files. Caution, the command
             destroys the pfile in use, leaving only the
             backup of the pfile, if there is one.


-----------------------------------------------------------
~
0 DEVOTE~
Syntax: 'devote <deity>'
        'devote none'

Devote allows you to devote yourself to a deity.  If you leave your deity
for another, your favor is set to -2300 and you are blinded for a period
of time. Devote is available to level 5 characters and higher.

Note: You must 'devote none' first before devoting to a new deity.

SEE ALSO: supplicate, deities, favor.
To see specific information about a deity, type 'deities [deityname]'
~
1 DEX DEXTERITY~
Dexterity (DEX in your 'score') represents your character's agility, and
it affects (among other things):

 - the maximum number of items you can carry at once in your inventory;
   with each additional point of dex you can carry additional items.

 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural
   armor class.

 - the number of new moves you receive each time you level, as well as the
   number of moves you regenerate at each tick (when resting to refresh or
   regain movement points).

 - success chances with bash, stun and gouge, and helps determine whether a
   thief will be able to poison a weapon or tumble effectively.

Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many
of the valuable vials.

Dexterity is the prime attribute of thieves and vampires.

~
36 DICEFORMULAS~
To make the special SMAUG spells possible, special dice formula handling
had to be coded in.  (At least to make it nice).  This dice formula code
supports full BEDMAS expressions ( ) ^^ / * + -, plus extra mud related
operators and variables:

D dice         L level          H hit points      M mana

~
31 DND~
On or off syntax: DND

This command toggles your personal dnd flag.
This command effectively secludes immortals from those of lower level.
Each immortal has a personal dnd flag associated with their pfile. In
addition, each room can have a dnd flag associated with the room.

When your personal dnd flag is set, lower level imms can't 'at', 'goto',
'trans', sight you on 'where' or 'where (name). This does not affect LD
immortals, they can still be transferred, even with the DND flag on. To
see the flag's status, 'mstat self', it will be listed under 'pcflags'.
Syntax for room flag: redit flags DND

The DND room flag effectively blocks any 'at', and 'goto' commands
either to the room, or to a mob/object in the room. NOTE: It is only
in effect if:
a) there is an immortal in the room with their DND flag on.
b) the immortal attempting the commands is of lower level than the
   immortal with the activated DND flag in the room.
~
0 DODGE~
Syntax:  operates automatically

Dodge is a skill which assists in the evasion of incoming attacks.  If
you are successful, your opponent's attack misses and you take will
take no damage. Dodge is an automatic skill and requires no weapon.

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax:  drop <object>
         drop <amount>  coins
Syntax:  get  <object>
         get  <object>  <container>
Syntax:  give <object>  <character>
         give <amount>  coins <character>
Syntax:  put  <object>  <container>
Syntax:  get/put/drop   <# amount>  <object>
Syntax:  get/put        <# amount>  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET takes an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or
even from a corpse (TAKE is a synonym for get).

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

Use 'drop/get/put all' to reference all objects present.
Use 'drop/get/put all.<object>' to reference all objects of the same name.

Examples:
 - drop 300 coins
 - get all.ball backpack
 - get 5 sword
 - put 15 potion backpack

~
32 ECHO RECHO~
Syntax:  echo      <color> <message>
         echo  imm <color> <message>
         echo  pc  <color> <message>
Syntax:  recho     <color> <message>

ECHO sends a message to all players in the game, without any prefix indicating
who sent it.  If 'echo imm <message>' is used, only level 31+ characters will
see the message. If 'echo pc <message>' is used, only player characters will
see the message. Echos should always adhere to the guidelines laid out in the
Realm of Order (vnum 1214).

ECHO done in color should avoid the use of red and dark red unless it is a
Urgent message containing important information related to the game.

RECHO sends a message to all players in your room, without any prefix
indicating who sent it.

See also : COLOR 'IMM ECHO'
~
31 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.

The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).

To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.

The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).

Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).

Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.

See ASET, FOLDAREA
~
1 EDITOR~

portal, simply type 'enter' on either side of it and you will pass
through to the other side.

~
1 EQDAMAGE~
While in combat, you may notice that your equipment is taking damage.  For
example, you may see "Your lifebane gets damaged."  Each time this happens,
the AC of the item is damaged by one.  If the AC on an item is 5, after it
is damaged more than five times it will be destroyed or scraped.

If you wish to preserve the equipment, you must repair it by taking it to
the town blacksmith. (NOTE:  Not all equipment is repairable)  You may also
notice that while fighting a creature which attacks you with acid breath or
another acid attack, your equipment gets "etched and pitted."  When this
occurs the AC on that item is damaged by one permanently.  You cannot
repair the damage done by "pitting and etching."

Less damage will be taken by a fighter using this style, but the damage
a fighter does in battle is also reduced due to the concentration needed
for evading an enemy.

31 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
Currently there can only be one exit in a certain direction.
The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.
~
0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~
31 EXITTYPES~
These are the currently valid exit-types:
      0 - Plain exit
      1 - Door exists         (Required to be closed or locked)
      2 - Door is Closed
      4 - Door is Locked
      8 - Door is Secret      (Trying to go that way won't reveal door)
     32 - Door is Pickproof   (Door can't be picked by spell or skill)
     44 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   324 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'redit exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

See EXFLAGS and EXITMAKING.
~
0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Syntax:  level

Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  Type LEVEL to see
how many experience points you'll need for the next few levels.

You gain experience by:
    inflicting damage upon an opponent
    being part of a group that kills an opponent
    succeeding while learning a skill or a spell through real world usage

You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of some spells (energy drain, etc.)
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:  how many
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment and some random variation.

Your last 30 kills are recorded.  Each time you kill a creature that has
been one of your last 30 kills you will receive less and less exp for it.
The creature will also learn from its experience with you over time; if
its intelligence is higher than your own it will begin to gain an
advantage over you in combat.
~
1 FAVOR~
Your favor reflects how much your deity favors you.  It can increase if you
follow the principles of your deity, and decrease if you go against those
wishes.  High favor gives you better chance rolls and weapon bonuses, while
low favor penalizes you.  You also use favor when you supplicate to your
deity for special services.

Note: If you deviate from your deity's alignment, you shall suffer a penalty
in favor for some actions.

SEE ALSO: deities, devote, supplicate, favor_levels

~
1 FAVOR_LEVELS~
The following lists the favor scale as listed on the 'score' sheet.
The prompt variable for favor uses the same scale, but with fewer
levels (thus is less accurate):

Loved
Cherished
Honored
Praised
Favored
Respected
Liked
Tolerated
Ignored
Shunned
Disliked
Dishonored
Disowned
Abandoned
Despised
Hated
Damned

~
0 FILL~
Syntax:  fill <drincon>
Syntax:  fill <container>
Syntax:  fill <pipe> <herb>

FILL can be used with drink containers, regular containers or pipes.
 - to fill a drink container, go to a fountain and 'fill <drinkcon>'
 - to fill a container such as a backpack with items from the ground,
   type 'fill <container>'
 - to fill a pipe you must have both the pipe and the herb in your
   inventory, then type 'fill <pipe> <herb>'

~
2 FLAG FLAGS~
&P(ATTACKER)&W, &P(KILLER) &Wand &P(THIEF) &Wflags are given to players who
violate laws regarding Pkilling and/or Theft. Having one of these flags
will cause Darkhaven mobs to treat you differently. You may be placed before
Judge Kendra and be fined or thrown in jail until an immortal can impose
a sentence upon you. For help on &P(ATTACKER) &Wor &P(KILLER) &Wflags, see
&CHELP ATTACKER &Wor &CHELP KILLER&W. To find out what constitutes illegal
theft, see &YLAWS STORES&W.
~
0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~
33 FLOODFILL~
Syntax: mapedit fill <sectortype>
Syntax: mapedit undo

Floodfilling is the process of changing all of the terrain within a contained
section of the map into another kind of terrain. It operates much the same way
as Windows Paint, or any other floodfill function in a graphics editor would.

You will first need to use the mapedit command to walk an outline on the map
in the shape you'd like it to be. Once you've done this, turn off your mapedit
flag and then step to the inside of the area you've just surrounded ( or to
the outside if you want to fill what's on the outside instead ).
Then, type: mapedit fill <sectortype> where sectortype is any sector in the
sectortypes list, except exits. The floodfill function will the proceed to
change everything inside the boundry from what your standing on, into what you
want it to be.

So if your standing on oceans, and you want to fill grassland inside the boundry,
type: mapedit fill grassland. That will change all the oceans into grasslands.

Note that you CANNOT specify a terrain type to fill in that is the same as what
you are standing on. To force the code to allow for that would create an infinite
loop, and so the fill operation will just fail instead.

If for some reason you need to undo what you've just filled in, simply type:
'mapedit undo' and your last floodfill will be reversed.

See also: SECTORTYPES, MAPEDIT
~
36 FOLDAREA~
Syntax:  foldarea <area filename>

This command saves an area file, usually after modification.

&rThis command must be used with extreme care.  If you aren't
exactly and intimately familiar with the changes being made
or what the command does -- don't use it.&w

*NOTE*
Area files have backups that record the file as it was prior to foldarea.
If you folda something and realize there's a mistake, and you've only
folded it once -- don't do anything else.  Post a note or find Blodkai.

Do not fold changes into non-quest areas that are quest related.  If you
must do this, write a note or ensure it's changed back.

Any time an area is folded, document it with the fixed command.
(check 'help fixed')

See ASET, UNFOLDAREA and INSTALLAREA.

~
1 FOLLOW~
Syntax:  follow <character>

'Follow' starts you following another character.  To stop following, type
'follow self'.  You cannot follow those more than ten levels above you.

You may follow lower level characters or characters up to ten levels higher.
You must first follow someone before you can join their group.

See also GROUP
~
36 FOR~
Syntax:  for (argument) (command)
Syntax:  for (argument) (command) (target)

For allows an immortal to perform a command at or even on a large
number of targets.  The arguments include:  all, mobs, gods.

Example:  for gods gl, you will 'glance' in the room of every god
who is online (include link-dead)

You can also perform an action on the argument target.
Example:  for mobs poke #, you will perform the 'poke' social on
every mob in the game.

'For' does not override private flags.
~
32 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character or mob to execute a command.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.

Force is restricted to mob use only until level 37.
  *Note.. NEVER force a mob to drop eq and give to a player..lest God
   smite thee down in your very tracks.
~
34 FORCECLOSE~
Syntax: forceclose <descriptor>

This command will force a certain descriptor to close.
This is useful to disconnect connections that aren't really connected
due to a poor TCP connection.

It can also be used to forceclose a connection before a potential
problem player can even get to the authorization state of connection.

See USERS, CONSTATES and DISCONNECT.
~
38 FSHOW~
-----------------------------------------------------------

     SYNTAX: fshow <moblog | plevel>

DESCRIPTION: The FSHOW command when used with the MOBLOG
             variable, displays the current log of MPLOG. When
             FSHOW is used with the PLEVEL variable, it will
             display the current log of all character levels
             that have occurred since the last reboot.

-----------------------------------------------------------
~
35 FURNITUREVALUES~
FURNITUREVALUES
It is now possible to sit/sleep/rest/stand on furniture.
Here is how all of this works.
value2 - sit/sleep/rest/stand on furniture (more below)
As for value2, it uses bitvictors, and here are their numbers
SIT ON -    1        SIT IN -    2        SIT AT -    4
STAND ON -  8        STAND IN -  16       STAND AT -  32
SLEEP ON -  64       SLEEP IN -  128      SLEEP AT -  256
REST ON -   512      REST IN -   324     REST AT -   2048
Furniture is set using the v2 setting and through adding the
values to make it work.  Say you want SIT ON and STAND IN, you
would add 1 and 16 and get 17.
A quick note, you can only be on in at an object.  If you
set all 3 of them to lets say Sit, when type type sit
object, they will sit at the object.  So only select
one.

41 GFIGHTING~
-----------------------------------------------------------

     SYNTAX: gfighting
             gfighting <low> <high>
             gfighting <low> <high> mobs

DESCRIPTION: The GFIGHTING command does a global search
             for the fighting targets specified, where
             <low> <high> indicates the target's level.

    EXAMPLE: gfighting 1 5 would display a list of PCs
             levels one through five that are fighting,
             who they are fighting and their level, what
             vnum/room name they are fighting in, and the
             name of the area they are fighting in. By
             adding the 'mobs' variable, the command
             would display the same information for mobs
             of the levels specified.

-----------------------------------------------------------
~
1 GODS~
The domains of Despair's Gods are often terror-filled and designed
to horrify and shock any mortal visitors. None have ever discovered
an entrance to any of these domains, for they are guarded by the
most powerful of godly magics.
~
1 GOHOME~
Syntax: gohome

After a player has acquired a house, they may use this command to
instantly transport themselves to their house.  It is similar to RECALL,
but GOHOME will take you home instead of the recall point.  However, it
will not work if you are in a "No Recall" or similar type of room.

See also: RECALL.
~
1 GOLD~
Syntax:  gold

Displays the current total amount of gold you are carrying.
~
31 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

GOTO takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

If the location is a vnum, and it does not already exist, and it is within
your room vnum range; it shall be created for your to edit further with
REDIT.

You may not GOTO a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present.

You may also "GOTO pk" to go to the site of the most recent illegal pkill.
See REDIT.

1 GROUP GROUPING~
Syntax:  group <character>, group all, group, group disband

'Group <character>' adds someone who is following you into your group, making
them a group member.  Group members share experience from kills, and may use
the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will
automatically join the fight.

If character is already a member of your group, 'group <character>' again to
remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group does not
stop them from following you, however.  A character can also leave a group
by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they will both leave your
group and stop following you.

'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

'Group all' groups all eligible players following you in the room.

'Group disband' allows the leader to disband his group (members will stop
following and are ungrouped).

You may group only characters within eight levels of your own.  See section
10 of your Adventurer's Guide for more information on groups and grouping.

See also GROUP DISPLAY
~
0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

DESCRIPTION: The GWHERE command displays a global location
             list of the targets specified; name of target
             and level, vnum/name of room, and name of area
             are all displayed, where <low><high> indicates
             the level of the players or MOBs. If level
             criterias are note defined, all will be displayed.

Colors &wcan now be added to help files using the same command set that changes
a player's prompt. &bMultiple &Ycolor &wcombinations can be set on a given line
including ^bbackground^x colors. However there are a couple of quirks to take
note of:
&Y
    1) At the very least, the first character of a help file cannot be
       either the symbol '&&' or the symbol '^^'.
    2) Color changes have to be separated by at least one character. ie,
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' will cause problems.
    3) Color codes are imbedded within text and _do_ count in note buffers
       for line length. ie, watch out for <Long Line Trimmed>.
&w
Colors should be used to &Yenhance &wthe help file, or specific parts of the
help file. Tact and restraint should be used if considering the use of colors.

31 HELL UNHELL~
Syntax: hell <character> <number> <hours or days>
Syntax: unhell <character>

The hell command sends a character to hell for a given period of time.  It
automatically releases the character when their time has been served.  Upon
being helled, the character receives the message, "The immortals are not
pleased with your actions.  You shall remain in hell for <time period>".

Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours".  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.

You may not hell someone for more than thirty days with the hell command.

To release a player from hell, simply "unhell <character>".
~
0 HELP~
You must really need Help!

To find help topics available to you, type hlist.  This will give you
a very long list of help files.  If you would like a shortened list,
type hlist a for help files that begin with the letter a.
~
1 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax:  hide
Syntax:  sneak
Syntax:  visible

If you successfully hide, creatures cannot see you unless they are affected
by 'detect hidden'.  Player characters can detect you, however.

If you successfully sneak, you can move from place to place without being
noticed by other player characters.  If you flee, you will stop sneaking
and will have to 'sneak' again.

In order to either hide or sneak successfully, you will have to practice
the appropriate skill.

Visible (vis) cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
effectively making you visible again to all.

~
1 HITROLL HR~
Represents your chances of hitting your opponent.  The higher
the number, the better.

~
1 HLIST~
Syntax: hlist <low level range> <high level range>

This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list
is in alphabetical order based on the first triggering keyword. While
this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them.

Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.

Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.
~
0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax:  hold   <object>
Syntax:  remove <object>
Syntax:  remove all
Syntax:  wear   <object>
Syntax:  wear   all
Syntax:  wield  <object>

Three of these commands will cause you to take an object from your inventory
and use it as equipment:

HOLD is for lights, wands and staves; WEAR is for armor; WIELD is for weapons.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD/WEAR/WIELD each suitable item in inventory.

REMOVE will take an object from your equipment and place it into inventory.

REMOVE ALL will remove all your equipment and place it into inventory.

~
31 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (31) for INVIS 31.  A
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will
say (Invis 31).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
~
1 HOME HOUSE HOUSING~
Within the realm of Eldha, players are able to buy a house/home for
themselves.  These are limited to just one home per character.  Upon the
acquisition of a home, players will gain the use of the GOHOME command
along with being able to write up a house description and choosing room
flags...for a price of course.

See also: GOHOME.
~
1 HOMEPAGE~
syntax: homepage <url>

example: homepage http://eldhamud.genesismuds.com

If you have a web page somewhere, you can use the homepage
command to show people a link to that page whenever they
select the 'see who's on' link from this MUD's home page.

To remove your homepage setting, type 'homepage clear'.

~
37 'HP'~
This is an abbreviation for hit points.  All classes begin with 20 hp
at creation and gain between 6 and 19 hp per gained level, depending on
class, race and CON.  Equipment can also add to your total hp.
~
31 HSET~
Syntax: hset  <command> [value] [help topic]
 save                            Saves all help pages (to help.are)
 level <level> <help topic>      Sets help topic to specified level
 keyword <keyword> <help topic>  Sets help keyword to specified keyword
 remove <level.><help topic>     Removes the specified help page

Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in spellcasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:

       Help file XYZZY at level 37, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 38.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 37 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 38.XYZZY' will remove the level 38 'SAVE XYZZY'.

Setting a help entry level to -1 prevents the header from showing up
when you view the help with the help command.

0 HUMAN HUMANS~
.
HELP HUMAN HUMANS

In the beginning there were Humans, Elves and Ogres. Humans are the most
numerous and the plainest race in the Realms. Although possessing no special
abilities or bonuses, they are the most adaptable and flexible race and are
able to assume any class. Humans are bipedal creatures with two arms
and a roundish head. Their height, weight, eye and hair color vary greatly. It
is rare to find any two who look exactly alike. In dark times Humans and Elves
mated creating a new race, called HALF-ELVES (see help HALF-ELF HALFELF) and
Humans and Ogres mated created the Half-Ogre Race.  (See help HALF-OGRE, or
help HALFOGRE)
~
1 ICESHIELD FIRESHIELD SHOCKSHIELD~
Iceshield conjures an encompassing shield of ice which will return the
attacks of your enemy with tongues of cold.
Syntax:  cast iceshield

Fireshield surrounds the caster with a wall of fire which returns your
enemies' attacks with balls of fire.
Syntax:  cast fireshield

Shockshield surrounds the caster with a field of electric energy which will
return your enemies' attacks with bolts of lightning.
Syntax:  cast shockshield
 * shockshield cannot be cast on others


The chances of your shields striking your opponent increase with your level,
with the odds at low levels being very low.

Like shields will negate each other's effects.  For example, if your enemy
has fireshield, your fireshield will counter any fireballs thrown by his,
and his will counter any fireballs thrown by yours.
~
0 IDEA TYPO BUG~
Syntax: bug  <message>
        idea <message>
        typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.

Both the bug and typo command will automatically record your location so you do
not need to try to explain where you are in the world.
~
0 IDENTIFY~
Syntax: cast identify <object>

This spell reveals information about the object.

                      applies to whatever room the mob is in.
                      You should use this form in mob programs only.

~
1 IGNORE~
Syntax:  ignore
Syntax:  ignore <character>
Syntax:  ignore reply/none

Ignore allows you to ignore other characters in the Realms.  All tells,
says, socials, and emotes from these characters will be blocked (gagged
out).  You will still see their communications through public channels,
however.

Simply typing ignore will give you a list of all the characters you are
currently ignoring.

Ignore <character> allows you to add or remove a character from your list
of ignored players.  If the name is already on the list it will be removed.
If the name is not on the list it will be added.  Note that only the names
of actual characters will be accepted and that it is not necessary for
them to be logged on at the time.

Ignore reply will cause you to ignore the last person to send you a tell.
This can be used to prevent invisible people from spamming you.

Ignore none will set you to ignoring no one.

~
31 IMM~
This immortal list of rules and regulations is currently under construction.

The helpfiles that are available are:

'help immrules'
'help imm invis'          'help imm echo'          'help imm recho'
'help imm auth'           'help imm forceclose'    'help imm force'
'help imm snoop'          'help imm freeze'        'help imm bodybag'

'help immortal'           'help creator'           'help savior'
'help demi god'           'help lesser god'
~
31 'IMM ECHO'~
Associated help files: echo

Echos should generally be medieval in nature, and their use confined
primarily to administrative functions, weddings, quest, role-playing
and the like.  Role-playing should be used rarely, however.

Though there is some leeway within these guidelines, some practices
are frowned upon and should be avoided.  Do not use your name in an echo
unless necessary.  Avoid comical phrases or 'cutsey' terms.  Do not use
:) or other symbols/punctuations at all.

If any of the above are necessary, there exist a sufficient number of
public channels via which the task can be accomplished while still
reaching a wide audience -  without forcing it onto the screen of
every character in the game.
~
31 'IMM EQUIP~
.                       Equipment Usage
                       ---------------
**  All equipment worn by an immortal must be made from vnum 1222.
**  No stats or affects may be added to vnum 1222.
**  If you need to test your mobs, you may make a weapon with the
    stats needed to test your mob.
~
31 'IMM FORCE'~
Associated help files: force

This command allows you to make someone execute a command.  Forcing
someone can often be looked at as high-handed.  Most common use of
force is to make someone do something as you are snooping, to check
problems or bugs, without waiting having to tell the character exactly
what to type.  It is always best to ask the person before you begin
forcing them.  You may also use force to make a player quit, drop,
or read something when you are punishing them.

Force all <command> can be done, but causes excessive lag because it
causes every player lower than you to attempt the command.  This should
be reserved to "force all save" in times of numerous crashes.  You should
never force all to use a channel.
~
31 'IMM FORCECLOSE'~
Associated help files: forceclose

This command will force a certain descriptor to close.  To use, you
must first look for the number listed under Desc on the user list.
Then type: forceclose <Desc #>

You can use forceclose to knock a trouble player offline, as well as
knock off someone who it stuck online.
~
31 'IMM FREEZE'~
Associated help files: help freeze

Syntax: deny         <character>
Syntax: disconnect   <character>
Syntax: freeze       <character>

DENY denies access to a particular player and throws them out of the game.
Deny is permanent (persists across reboots) and is not undoable from within
the game.  Only someone with access to the player files directory may repeal
a DENY by editing the appropriate player file.

DISCONNECT <character> immediately disconnects that character.

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all.
~
31 'IMM GOTO'~
Syntax: goto <name>

This is a reminder to use common courtesy when using such commands
as goto.   Not only is it considered inappropriate to goto higher
level immortals without asking permission, the same could be said
when wanting to visit any player on the mud.  A quick tell requesting
to visit would suffice.  For those of you who frequent headquarters,
either Clans, Guilds or Orders, requesting permission, though not
necessary, is certainly welcome.  Note that if a mortal requests that
you leave their hq, and you have no pressing business, you are obligated
to abide by their wishes.  (This does not apply to high ranking immortals.)

~
31 'IMM INVIS'~
Associated help files: invis and wizinvis

Those Immortals between levels 31 and 34 may invis to level 31 when they
are running or preparing a quest, involved in a building projects that
requires you to be uninterrupted, or you are actively watching a mortal.
At all other times, the Immortal should be visible to all levels of mortals
and Immortals.  Wizinvis is to be used as a tool to assist you in your duties
as an Immortal, it is not a means to spy on others or hide.

Immortals of level 35 and above may use wizinvis beyond 31 to work on
projects or monitor another person.  It is mandatory to be visible to all
other immortals whenever reasonably able to do so.  Keep the use of
"Someone" to a minimum on channels.  Exceptions are when you need to answer
a question, make a comment, or pass on some information, but are too busy
to become visible.
~
31 'IMM RECHO'~
Associated help files: recho

Rechos should generally be medieval in nature, and their use confined
primarily to administrative functions, weddings, quest, role-playing
and the like.  Recho can be seen by all players in one room.  Do not
use recho to "scare" mortals.  Recho is seen on logs, be cautious in
using them in social/private situations.
~
31 'IMM SNOOP'~
Associated help files: snoop

The snoop command is a very valuable tool, when used appropriately.  Snoop
not only allows you to watch another person, but to see the world through
their eyes, helping to track down problems the person may be experiencing.
The reasons for snooping are too varied to mention here, but the reasons
NOT to snoop are easily listed.

-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
   snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- If a higher level Immortals requests you to stop snooping, do so quickly.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded.
    ** For example, you learn someone is having a mud affair from snoop.
    ** This information has nothing to do with the reason you are snooping
    ** and should not affect your judgement.  It should not be passed on.
-- Being an Immortal is a privilege and a job.  Snoop is a tool to assist
   you do your job properly.  Snoop is neither a toy nor a right.

         outcast <player>

Induct and outcast are clan commands.  The leader and number 1 of the
clan receive the induct commands, while the deity, leader, number 1 and
number 2 all receive outcast.  Induct will bring a new player into the
clan, while outcast will remove them.
~

HELP files.  You may also read sections 1 and 20 in your Adventurer's Guide
book to learn more about these commands.
~
39 INSTALLAREA~
Syntax: installarea <area filename> <full area name/title>

Installs a prototype area into the mud as a non-prototype area.
The filename can be fixed with aset, (don't forget to foldarea the new name.)

Currently the builder should quit and have his/her vnums cleared manually.
(This should be fixed soon).
~
1 INT INTELLIGENCE~
Intelligence (INT in your 'score') represents your character's mental
capacity.  Among other things, it affects:

 - heavily influences the amount of mana a character gains at level

 - affects the amount of mana regenerated or recovered at each tick
   if a character is resting or sleeping

 - the rate at which a character learns a new skill or spell

 - the percentage rate at which a character practices a new language

Intelligence is an important factor in learning between combatants.  If
a character fights a creature several times, the more intelligent of the
two opponents will gain an advantage over time...

Intelligence is the prime attribute of the mage.

~
45 IPCOMPARE~
Syntax: ipcompare <name>
        ipcompare <site>
        ipcompare <name or site> <room|area|world> <#>

This takes * as a wild card.
Ipcompare will compare online users to search for multiplayers. A positive
match using ipcompare does not always mean it is a multiplayer..but shows
that there are more than one user from a site on simultaneously.
Ipcompare <field> <#> will limit the output to x number of lines based on #.
* may be used as a wild card, for example ipcompare 207.18.3.* will return
matches from any that begin with the ip prior to the asterisk.
Ipcompare <field> <room|area|world> will limit the search based on that
criteria.  The room|area|world limitation will be judged on the room that
the immortal issued the command in.  So if you are in a different area
than the victim, it will show only players matching the site in the area
you are in.
~
33 ITEMVALUES~
In these values, 'sn' is a spell number;  a negative value means 'no spell'.

~
38 KHISTORY~
Syntax: khistory <player>

This command will display a list of mobs recently killed by the
character in question.
This is an imm only command.
~
1 KILL MURDER~
KILL MURDER
Syntax:  kill     <character>
Syntax:  murder   <character>   -- must be level 5 or higher to murder

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.

MURDER is used to initiate attacks on other player characters (WARNING:
see 'laws pkill' for restrictions on attacking other players).  You must
be level 5 or higher to be able to use the murder command.

~
2 KILLER KILLERFLAG KILLERFLAGS~
&WThe mud will automatically assign you a &PKiller &Wflag if you cause the
death of another player. Only situations which involve peacefuls being
killed by mortals, or &RDeadlies &Wkilling fellow clanmembers will result
in the assignment of this flag. You will receive a &PKiller &Wflag if:

  1. You caused the DEATH of another player, regardless of who attacked first.
  To help prevent yourself from acquiring a &PKiller &Wflag after being
  attacked, set yourself to &YConfig +Nice &W(See &CHelp Config &Wfor info).

  2. You were the Master of a mobile which killed another player while
  under the influence of your charm. PLEASE NOTE that you will receive a
  &PKiller &Wflag even if the player that died attacked the charmed
  mobile without the Master's permission. Charmers and Pet Owners are held
  responsible for the actions of their Pets/Charmies. (See &CHelp Charm
  &Wand &CHelp Pets &Wfor more info on these topics).

  3. You are a &RDeadly &Wplayer and caused the death of a fellow Clanmember.
~
1 KILLSTEAL KILLSTEALING~
Don't do it.
Kill stealing occurs when a player attacks a mob that is already being
fought. This is both annoying and illegal. If someone should do this to
you please inform them of the rules. If they continue, seek an immortal
but do not take the law into your own hands.
~
1 LANGUAGES~
Syntax: languages
Syntax: language learn <language name>

Languages alone shows which languages you know, and "language learn
<name>" will add to your percentage of language knowledge.  To learn a
language, a scholar who is knowledgable in that tongue must be present.

If someone is speaking in a language, and you know it, you will
understand what they are saying.  However, to change the language in which
you are speaking, you must change that manually.  (See help on SPEAK).

See also LANGUAGE , SPEAK
~
1 LCK LUCK~
Luck (LCK in your 'score') represents the tendency of a character to succeed
or prosper through chance or good fortune.  As in life, the exact extent of
this factor remains and will always remain shrouded in uncertainty...

Also as in life, however, it can be said with surety that its influence on a
character is pervasive.  Though it affects some aspects of life here in a
very direct manner, it can affect nearly every aspect to at least a degree.

1 LIGHT~
Syntax:  light <pipe>

This lights the herb in your pipe.  Once lit, the herb will continue to
burn until it burns itself out, is smoked out, or you tamp your pipe.
~
1 LIMBO~
The limitless void known as Limbo is a strange plane fabricated by
the Gods to hold mortals who have been rendered unconscious or have
been mortally wounded. It is a well known fact that only Gods may travel
here of their own volition.

See OSET and ITEMVALUES.
~
45 LOADUP~
Syntax:  loadup <player>

LOADUP allows one to load up a player's character (playing or not), to do
whatever needs be done to the character.  (Modifying a flag, changing a
password... etc).  Use FORCE to make the character do your bidding.

If we make any changes to the char, we comment the char and place a note in
their inventory explaining who loaded them up and what changes were made.
The character is transed to room 99 and forced to quit there (unless they
are going to be left in hell).  If we don't make any changes to the char, we
trans them back from where they came and force quit them there.  Loadup is
used primarily when a player quits to avoid dealing with immortals or if
they quit before you finish writing a comment.  But it is also used to
investigate chars for duping and other allegations made against them.

So... there is actually a wide range of reasons to use loadup and you are
encouraged to use your discretion in this area.

If you load up a character to slay or purge them, you must post in 1205.

35 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
Syntax: log   all
Syntax: snoop <character>

LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent character toggle.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.
The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the players
name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
     snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded
    ** For example, you hear someone is having a mud affair, it is not
    ** important to the reason you are snooping.  Do not judge or pass
    ** on information learned in this manner.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Being an Immortal is a privilege and a job.  Snoop is a tool to assist
   you do your job properly.  Snoop is neither a toy nor a right.

It's a fairly involved portion of the OLC code as a whole, but is not
terribly difficult to use.

Typing 'mapedit' with no other arguments toggles your editor on or off.
When on, any movement you make will change the sector you're moving to
into whatever you have yourself set for. Think of it as "painting".

To set yourself to create a sector, simply type 'mapedit sector <type>'
where the type is something from the sectortypes list. Also note that
while you are in edit mode, typing 'look' will cause the sector you are
in to be changed.

To save changes to a map, type 'mapedit save <mapname>'. If you leave out
the mapname, the map you are currently on will be the one saved.

-1 MENTALSTATE MENTALSTATES 'MENTAL STATE' 'MENTAL STATES'~
.
&gYour mental state is your current frame of mind, and how clearly and
realistically you view your surroundings.  Mental states can be affected
by prolonged combat, hunger, thirst, or poison.  If you are affected by
one of the above for a period of time, your mental state will begin to
deteriorate, and you will not view your surroundings as they truly are.
You may begin to hallucinate, or become too lethargic to function, and
your general abilities will be affected.  In extreme cases you may
collapse from exhaustion or enter a delirious coma.

To restore your mental state, you may need to rest (resting and sleeping
will speed your recovery), eat, cure whatever poison afflicts you, etc.
Note that if you are malnourished your state will &wnot&g improve, even with
sleep, until you have fed and/or quenched your thirst.

Your mental state is by the text line in 'score' which describes your state
of mind (You feel great, etc.)  The 'group' display contains a less accurate
reading of your and your group-mates' mentalstates as well.

Note:  Changing your deity now affects your mental state.

-1 MIP 'MESSAGING INTERFACE PROTOCOL'~
This MUD has been optimized to support Portal's MIP (Messaging Interface
Protocol) features. If you are using the Portal client software, this protocol
allows the mud to trigger events on your computer in a secure manner.

A few of the major features that the protocol supports:
* Playing sound effects and music
* Displaying still or animated images
* In-game downloading of media
* Tell monitoring
* Channel monitoring
* Much, much more!

The MIP specifications were developed by GiftWicks LLC, the creators of the
Portal mud client. The SMAUG support module was developed by Chris Coulter
(aka Gabriel Androctus) and released to the public domain.

33 MISSILES~
Creating a projectile is basically the same as making any other
weapon. The exception to this are its Values (see ITEMVALUES)
and the need to have missiles which match missileweapons.

&GFollow this basic proceedure to make a set of projectiles&W:
  1) Create a firing mechanism, for instance, a long bow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'missileweapon'.
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take missile'
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the Value3 (V3) from the table in HELP WEAPONTYPES.

&G Now the wielded weapon is done, but you need something to fire...&W
  1) Create a shootable object, for instance, an arrow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'projectile'
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take'.
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the V3 to match the V3 on the firing mechanism you created.

Don't forget to finish the items with weight, cost, long, short etc.
You now have two objects in inventory which are ready to fire.
Lastly, you may create a quiver for certain objects. To do this,
set the itemtype to 'quiver', and use v0 to set its capacity.
Be sure not to set the capacity too high, as quivers should be small.

0 MOUNT DISMOUNT~
Syntax: mount <mob>
Syntax: dismount

Mount is a skill, which allows you to mount certain mobs.  Being mounted
on a mob cuts down on movement points that are used whenever you move.

New water sectors allow a person mounted to traverse them without damage
from drowning.  If you are in an area where your movement points begin
to drop suddenly and/or you begin to lose hps <hitpoints> quickly, you
should try to mount immediately.
~
1 MOVE MOVEMENT~
This discusses the process of moving your character from one place in the
Realms to another.  The common movements are north, east, south, west, up
down, northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest.  You may also move
in these directions by the use of n, e, s, w, u, d, ne, se, sw, and nw.
If you need to pass through a door, at times they require being unlocked
and opened. To unlock a door, you type UNLOCK <direction or door name>.
To open a door, you type OPEN <direction or door name>.

At times, you may run out of movement points or require healing.  To allow
for faster recovery, you may SIT, REST, or SLEEP.  When are finished with
your recovery, and wish to continue adventuring, type WAKE or STAND.

For more detailed information on movement and doors, read sections 7 and
8 of your Adventurer's Guide book.

be targeted by an 'mpapply <victim>' which will inform the immortals that
the character is waiting for authorization.  Once the character is
authorized, a mob will attempt to 'mapplyb <victim>' the character, and
the character will be sent into the actual game.

to tell the mob which area to withdraw/deposit money in.

Example:  mpat 2300 mpwithdraw 3000000

This would cause the mob to withdraw 5 million coins from the new Darkhaven
area, as that is the area vnum 2300 is in.

completely invisible to them.

Be warned, however, that its programs will still function as normal, the
mortal will simply see a 'someone' if it performs an action or an echo

...Everything begins to fade to black.  You feel yourself leaving your body.
Rising up into the air, you feel more free than you have ever felt before...

However, before your deity comes to collect your soul, you feel a strange
pulling sensation as strange and colorful mists swirl around you...

A low voice fills your head with words of advice... "When your character
dies, you are reincarnated at the cathedral of Notre  Dame de Sioux in New
Darkhaven; should you one day become a member of a  clan, guild or order you
will be returned to your own altar."

"Your corpse, however, is left behind where you were killed, together with
all of your equipment, so that you can attempt to return to the scene and
loot your corpse.  Your gold stays with you.  Corpses decay after time,  and
when this happens the objects inside will decay with it."

"Once you have chosen a deity and gained sufficient favor, you may be able
to supplicate to your deity for your corpse.  Type 'help death' for more
information.  This message will appear only on your first two deaths..."

33 OLIST~
Syntax: olist
      :	olist <first object>
      :	olist <first object> <last object>

This command will list all of the prototype objects in your area, when used
with no arguments.  When used with a single argument it will list all
objects including and after the argument, and when used with two arguments,
it will list all objects including and between the two.

Syntax: close  <object|direction>
Syntax: lock   <object|direction>
Syntax: unlock <object|direction>
Syntax: pick   <object|direction>
Syntax: bolt   <direction>
Syntax: unbolt <direction>

OPEN and CLOSE open and close an object or a door.
LOCK and UNLOCK lock and unlock a closed object or door.  You must have
the requisite key to LOCK or UNLOCK.
PICK can open a lock without having the key.  In order to PICK successfully,
you must practice the appropriate skill.

BOLT and UNBOLT bolt and unbolt a closed door.  You must be on the side of
the door that has the bolt to BOLT or UNBOLT the door.
~
33 OPSTAT~
Syntax: opstat <object/object vnum>

Opstat will display all of the objprograms that have been written for the
specified object.  If a copy of the object exists in the game, it can be
accessed by its vnum.

See OPEDIT, TRIGGER, OPTRIGGERS, OPCOMMANDS, IFCHECKS, IFCHECKS2 VARIABLES
~
31 OSET~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>
         oset object on

If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.

Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.

If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.

1 OVERLAND WILDERNESS 'ANSI MAP' 'ASCII MAP'~
EldhaMUD now features an ANSI map which represents the
terrain features of the area between zones. There are 3 maps, one
for each of the 3 continents of the planet. Travelling on them is much
the same as wandering through an area, except that you can see several
spaces around you as you travel.

It looks something like this:

&w^^^^^^^^^
^&g*******&w^
^&g***&WX&g***&w^
^&g**&WX&R@&WX&g**&w^
^&g*******&w^
^&g*******&w^
^^^^^^^^^&z

Each of the colored symbols represents a different kind of terrain.
The &R@&z symbol is you, and the &WX&z symbols are exits off of the map,
either
to other maps, or to regular zones such as Darkhaven. It is possible to
encounter random monsters roaming the map.

The map is best viewed with ANSI color turned on.

specified pager length.  To set it, first set a desired page length using:

Pager <# of lines>

Initially, page length is set to 24 lines.  Once page length is set, use
the Config command to turn it on and off, or simply type 'pager'.

Commands available within the pager are:

(C)ontinue, (R)efresh, (B)ack, (Q)uit.

With 'continue' being the default item.  When the screen pauses, hit the

0 PASSWORD~
Syntax:  password  <new password>   <new password>

PASSWORD changes your character's password.  You repeat the new password only.
If you do not get it correctly it will not work.  This should end the typo
locking you out of your character.
The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged; it is
impossible for any immortal to in any way see, find or retrieve it.  It
is the responsibility of the player to ensure that the password of the
character is kept secure.

Passwords can not contain certain characters, or spaces.  We also advise
that you use an alphanumeric password (one containing both numbers and
letters) as they are harder to guess.  We also recommend that you choose
a password that is greater than 6 characters in length.  A good rule of
thumb is if it is in the dictionary, it is probably not a good password.

NOTE:  if you decide to trade a character, you do so at your own risk.
Immortals are not responsible for ensuring fair trades.  You may seek an
immortal to oversee a trade, but it is not their  responsibility.

&YThe password policy is:  password equals ownership.&w

0 QUEST~
Syntax: quest <command>
QUEST commands: POINTS INFO TIME REQUEST REFUSE COMPLETE LIST BUY ENHANCEMENT.

In Athelstan, adventurers are able to better their characters through questing.
This can keep someone quite busy if they choose to partake in the quests
available to the brave adventurers of the land.  If this doesn't apply to you,
then you're better off doing something else, but if you are courageous enough,
then this is the way to go.  You must first seek out and find a Quest Master.
Only after you have done this may you begin in your adventures.
~
1 QUESTS QUESTING~
.
  Quests are run at random times for different groups of players within the
realms.  They may involve anything from a scavenger hunt, to solving riddles,
to killing mobs that threaten the Realms.  Quests are an excellent way to
meet other players, and enhance roleplaying throught the realm.
  Different quests will result in different awards.  Awards are up to the
discretion of the immortal running the quest.

Some things to remember while questing:

 &W-&GWe are volunteers, and choose to run quests. If you have criticisms of
    the quest, or the person running the quest, please be constructive and
    vent your concerns in an appropriate forum - in the Hall of Heroes located
    in the Darkhaven Town Hall.

 &W-&GDo not ask when the next quest will be, or if there is a quest. Just pay
    attention to channels and what is going on around you.  If something out
    of the ordinary is going on, there's a good chance it might be a quest.

 &W-&GUnless explicitly stated, Multi-playing is &YNOT&G allowed during quests.
    IF you are caught multi-playing, you will forfeit any reward, and most
    likely have a temporary ban from questing placed on the characters involved

~
1 QUIT~
Syntax: QUIT

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room, unless that room has a prog that moves
you upon re-entry.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just
one command.  Nevertheless, it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you
get into the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other
mud that doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT here.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~
0 RACE RACES~

2 RACETALK~
Syntax:  racetalk <message>

The racetalk channel will send your message to all the members of
your race currently online.  This channel can be used to roleplay
in accordance with the characteristics of your race, to plan runs
or grouping with a more focused body of players, or for general
chatter.  Please note that racetalk is partially designed to
promote roleplaying, so attempting to limit yourself to the
characteristics of your race may enhance your enjoyment of the mud,
and may provide a unique experience for those who have never
roleplayed previously.

38 RASSIGN MASSIGN OASSIGN~
Syntax: rassign
        oassign

38 RAT~
Syntax: rat vnum1 vnum2 command [parameters]

Rat, or 'range at' is the at command with the added parameters of two

~
38 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK~
Syntax: reboot <nosave>
Syntax: shutdown <nosave>
Syntax: wizlock

REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level 31 may not log in.  Players who lose their links, however,
may reconnect.

If nosave is specified for reboot or shutdown, it will not automatically
save all of the players.

exit    | <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keywords]
bexit   | same as above, but does the exit in both directions

excoord | <direction> <x> <y>    -- sets an exit's coordinates onto a map

Note: When setting exit coordinates, be sure the exit is flagged "overland"
      or it will not work. The exit will lead out to whichever map covers
      the continent the area is on.

Note: Put a '+' before the direction to force ADDing of that exit
      and use a '#' to specify the exit by sequential order.

RSET ON will lock you into a mode in which 'redit' is implied in each command
sequence, and hitting enter will give you an instant rstat of whichever room
you are in at the time. To get out of REDIT ON, simply type the word DONE.
Example:

        rset on
        name A dark and forboding hallway
        flags dark indoors
        done

~
1 REMAINS~
Syntax:  remains

A worshipper may request knowledge on the disposition of their remains
from his or her deity (meaning the location and remaining time before
complete decay).  However, the imposition comes at the cost of a small
amount of favor -- approximately twice that of the character's level.

If no remains exist, there is no penalty to favor.

SEE ALSO:  supplicate
~
1 REBORN~
Syntax: Reborn

Typing this allows you to reset your level to 10 in exchange for the
ability to gain greater HP and different skills your next time through.
You can do this as many times as you want and you must be an avatar to
remort.
~
1 RENAME~
A rename may be done by a level 34 or higher immortal.  If you wish
for the rekey to be completed at the same time, you must contact a
level 36 or higher immortal.  The rename can be purchased with 20
glory or a rename scroll.  Wedding renames are done with a marriage
license by Blorin, the Darkhaven engraver.  (See help wedding)
Renames are to be medieval in style for mortals and must not contain
the name of an immortal without their expressed consent.  Items will
not be renamed to machine gun, silly putty, etc.
Before contacting an immortal to redeem glory or scrolls for a rename,
please have in mind what you would like done.  You will need to consider
the following:
Short description - what is seen when the item is worn by a person.
Long description - what is seen when the item is lying on the ground.
Rekey - the renaming of the item (usually something from the short desc)

~
33 REPAIRSHOPS~
Syntax: repairshops

Displays statistics on all the repair shops.

See MAKEREPAIR, REPAIRSET and REPAIRSTAT.
~
33 REPAIRSTAT~
Syntax: repairstat <mobile vnum>

Shows statistics on a mobile's repair shop.

~
31 REPEAT~
Syntax: repeat <letter>

This command will repeat tell messages which you
have already received. If no parameters are given
it will simply produce the last tell you received.
If a single letter is given, then the last tell
sent to you by a character with a name starting
with that letter will be displayed. This is an imm
only command.

1 'REPORT' 'TIME' 'WEATHER'~
Syntax: report;  Syntax: time;  Syntax: weather

REPORT shows your current statistics to you and also announces them to other
players in the room.

TIME shows the game time, as well as the time the mud was last started,
and the current local time for the host computer.

WEATHER shows the current game weather.  You must be in an outside room
to see the weather.
~
31 RESERVE~
.
The "Reserve" command enables us to specify certain names that are
reserved and cannot be used by players.

We can specify names that we want to reserve because they belong to
former imms (like Narn and Dominus). We can specify names that are
often tried and are a bit of a pain (like Killer or Satan or Seth).

We can specify parts of names by preceding the string with an "*">
e.g.  reserve *goof
This will prevent any name with the substring "goof" ... like ...
"goofface", "biggoof" or "biggoofface".
All deity names should be reserved.

reserve                        list current reserved names
reserve joe                    add joe to the list if he's not on it
reserve joe                    remove joe to the list if he is on it
reserve *goof                  add the substring "goof" to the list

Syntax: reset edit   <number> <command> <parameters>
Syntax: reset area   (will "reset" your area based on the defined resets)

WARNING:
  The order that resets are in is VERY important.  You cannot equip
  a mobile with an object before putting the mobile into a room first.
  Likewise, you cannot put an object into a container until the container is
  put into a room first.

This command is used to display, edit, delete, add and insert resets for
your area.

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax:  rest
Syntax:  sleep
Syntax:  stand

These commands change your position.

When you REST or SLEEP, you regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement
points at a much faster rate.  However, you are more vulnerable to attack,
and if you SLEEP you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can also WAKE
other sleeping characters.

~
1 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
        restore all

RESTORE restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  RESTORE ALL does this for all mortals except player
killers and any who happen to be in the arena.

A note on RESTORE ALL: This is a gift from the gods, and it is never
planned in advance or done on request.  The best way to ensure that a
restore all will NOT be done is to ask for one.
~
33 RESTORETIME~
Restoretime shows you how much time has passed since you last did a
restore all. All Immortals between the levels of 33 and 36 can do one
restore all per 18 hours of Real Time. Those of level 37+ can restore
all at any given time, upon their discretion.

See RPEDIT, TRIGGER, RPTRIGGERS, RPCOMMANDS, IFCHECKS, IFCHECKS2, VARIABLES
~
1 SACRIFICE~
Syntax:  sacrifice <object>

Sacrifice offers an object to the gods, or to your Order or Clan's deity.
The gods may reward you for the sacrifice, and the nature of the reward
depends upon the type of object.

Hint: the gods like corpses.
~
0 SALVE APPLY~
In your travels you may come across various ointments and salves.
Use 'apply <itemname>' to rub some of the salve onto your skin.

( For Smaug Release.. A sample salve is available in vnum 2384)
~
1 SAVE~
Syntax:  Save

SAVE saves your character and its inventory; you must be at least second
level to save.  The system automatically saves approximately one character
every minute, but with the high number of players usually online it may take
hours before your own is auto-saved.  For this reason, you should not
rely on auto-save to keep your character updated -- save frequently.

Type SAVE immediately after recovering your corpse, gaining experience or
a level in battle, getting new items, making purchases or repairs, etc.

Some objects (such as keys) may not be saved.  You cannot SAVE and QUIT
with objects of a higher level than your own, as they will vanish when
you log out.  Every character is auto-saved at reboot.

~
1 SAVE POSITIONS~
At current time, there are 14 "positions" in the game. Positions
are in a special order.  If position b is below position a on the
list, that indicates that while in position b, you have more
physical or mental energy to spend on a task, be it a command,
a spell, or a skill.

For example, while standing, you have a greater ability to do things
than while sitting.  While fighting evasively, you have more options
than while fighting aggressively.

The ordered list is as follows, left to right, top to bottom:
Dead          Mortally Wounded        Incapacitated
Stunned       Sleeping                Fighting (Berserk)
Resting       Fighting (Aggressive)   Sitting
Fighting (Std)Fighting (Defensive)    Fighting (Evasive)
Standing      Mounted

1 'SCAN'~
Syntax:  scan <direction>

This skill enables you to scan for one or more rooms in the direction

0 SCRIBE BREW~
&YSyntax&W: brew <spell name>
&YSyntax&W: scribe <spell name>

A mage or cleric of sufficient level holding a 'blank scroll or
'empty flask' may transform them into spelled scrolls or potions via
the scribe and brew commands.

It takes significantly more mana to bind a spell to a potion or scroll
than to simply cast it.

Note that a fire is required to brew potions.
~
0 SCRY~
Syntax:  cast scry

This spell will allow the character to scry (look) in to nearby rooms.
After casting the spell, the character needs only to "look" in the

~
33 SETEXIT~
Syntax: setexit create
Syntax: setexit delete
Syntax: setexit <vnum>
Syntax: setexit map <mapname> <X-coord> <Y-coord>

The setexit command allows you to manipulate exits from the overland
to rooms or other maps. The command is fairly straightforward.

To create a new exit, simply type 'setexit create' while standing on
your overland map.

To delete an existing exit, simply type 'setexit delete' while standing
on the coordinates of the exit sector. You will probably need to use the
'coords' command to move onto the exit sector.

To set an exit from the map into a regular zone, type
'setexit <vnum>' where vnum is the target room's vnum.

To set an exit from one map to another map, type
'setexit map <mapname> <X> <Y>' where mapname is the name you gave to
the target map, x is the target x coordinate, and y is the target y
coordinate.

Any manipulation of an exit automatically saves the entrances.dat file
to disk, so there is no need to worry about saving that file.

See also: COORDS, MAPEDIT
~
33 SETMARK~
Syntax: setmark add
Syntax: setmark delete
Syntax: setmark desc <destription>
Syntax: setmark distance <distance>

Landmarks are the points on the overland maps that the survey command uses
to display its information to players. The data is stored in a simple text
file in the directory with the ANSI maps.

To add a landmark, go to the coordinates you want it to be at and simply
type: setmark add

To remove one, go to the coordinates it is at and simply type:
setmark delete

The description is just a short line of text to describe what the survey
command sees. When editing the description, keep it as short as possible,
do not capitalize words unless referring to names, and do not add punctuation
to the end of the line. To change the description, go to the landmark
coordinates and type: setmark desc <text>, Where <text> is the
description you want.

Distance is the number of spaces the landmark is visible from on the overland.
Try not to make the distance too large, or too small. Anything visible for
more than 50 or so spaces is most likely too large - unless the landmark is
intended to display a large geographical feature such as a mountain.

To see the existing list of landmarks and their locations, type: landmarks

Setrace <racename> &g minalign&w/&gmaxalign &w sets min and maxs  from
 -300  to 300 to determine if a penalty will be applied.  If the max align is
300 - character would suffer a mental state penalty for straying above 300.

~
1 SPAM~
No, we are not talking about a luncheon meat here.  Spam is the repeated use
of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen scroll for others.  Not
only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll can interfere with
the game play of anyone seeing it (not to mention combat situations).  The
game will also tell you to PUT A LID ON IT and force-quit you after the 20th
repeat of a single command

It is also considered spam to use the same phrase over several different
channels.  The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use
capitals to add emphasis to key words in a sentence.

Moving a large number of items into and out of a container in a crowded,
non-store room is considered spam.  Using multiple characters to chat the
same message at the same time is considered spam.  Making charmed mobs
or pets to cause screen scroll through movement or orders is considered
spam. ANYTHING that causes excessive or irritating screen scroll can be
considered spam.
~
1 SPEAK LANGUAGE~
Syntax:  speak
Syntax:  speak <language>
Syntax:  speak all (immortals only)

To speak your native tongue, type 'speak' alone.  To speak a specific

~
1 STR STRENGTH~
Strength (STR in your 'score') represents your character's physical power.

The most common concern with strength deals with how much your character
can carry.  For each additional point of strength  you gain an additional
amount of maximum carryable weight.  Any character with 20 strength can
carry 300kgs; Warriors and Rangers can have a maximum of 25 strength, and
can therefore carry up to 999kgs when their strength is at its maximum.

Strength also affects (among other things):

 - damage roll and hitroll; for each additional point of strength, each
   of these will increase

 - chances of success for bash, stun, bashdoor, shove and drag, and the
   ability to dual-wield heavier weapons

styles. Styles can be changed within combat to better ones advantage
and knowledge of each of the different forms of combat.

45 SURVEY~
The survey command is used on the overland maps to scan your
surroundings for visible landmarks. You will get a rough
estimate of distance to the landmark, and its general direction
from where you are standing. Some landmarks will be more visible
than others. If you are within range of more than one landmark,
all of the ones you can see will be displayed.

Example:

To the north, in the near vicinity, a pitch black monolith rises toward the
sky.
To the southeast, in the near vicinity, whisps of smoke rise up from a small

~
0 TICK~
Many of the actions in the Realms are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in these Realms average 40 seconds of real time, but the
actual amount varies randomly from 45 seconds to 75 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present; Also,
some lower level areas have shorter reset periods, while some higher level
areas have longer reset periods.

Note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is
in the area when it resets.

Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' or other messages just prior
to the reset itself.

until the corpse has reached below a timer of 23 or has hit the
"fills the air with a foul stench." stage in decay.

You can see what stage of decay a corpse is in by either typing:

worth a certain amount of Practices, Quest Points, Experience and Gold with
some giving more than others.  To exchange the token, go to the NPC designated
as the token exchanger and give the token to it.  You will be rewarded upon
exchange.

on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~
1 TUMBLE~
Syntax:  operates independently

Tumble is a high-level thief skill for the evasion of incoming attacks.
The skill functions autonomically, and its effectiveness is greater for
more dexterous thieves.

~
39 UNFOLDAREA~
Syntax:  unfoldarea <area filename>

This command will load up an area file.

NOTE:  It could be quite dangerous to unfold an area that is already
       loaded, or one that has not been tested.

~
34 USEPROG~
Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]

The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke

When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~
34 USERS~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.43, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.
~
33 VARIABLE VARIABLES~
This is the list of variables to be used in actiondescs for objects and in
mob/room/object programs.

VARIABLE         MOBILE  ACTOR  VICTIM  RANDOM  OBJECT  2ND_OBJECT
---------------  ------  -----  ------  ------  ------  ----------
Name               $i     $n      $t      $r      $o        $p

31 WATCH~
. &w
&W Syntax: &G watch                  &W Shows you a help screen
&W Syntax: &G watch size             &W Shows the size of your watch file
&W Syntax: &G watch clear            &W Deletes your watch file
&W Syntax: &G watch show             &W Shows all your active watches
&W Syntax: &G watch player <name>    &W Starts watching a player
&W Syntax: &G watch site <site>      &W Starts watching all players from site
&W Syntax: &G watch delete <number>  &W Stops a watch
&W Syntax: &G watch print 1          &W Shows file starting at line 1
&W Syntax: &G watch print 300        &W Shows file starting at line 300
&W Syntax: &G watch print 300 30    &W Shows 30 lines starting at line 300

Watch will work 24 hours a day from the time you put a watch on a player until
you take it off. You can also watch all players from a specific site.

We need you to be real careful about the size of your watch file. If you
are watching a number of players or sites, please do not just forget about
your watches and allow your watch file to grow to outrageous sizes. You
should never have more than 5,000 or 10,000 lines in your watch file.
If you are doing some watching, be sure you check your watch file daily
and either print it, display it, copy it to your hard drive or do whatever
you need to do with it but then ... please ... please ... be sure you
clear it so that it don't grow huge and eat up all our hard drive space.
If you clear your watch file daily ... there should be no problem. If you
aren't watching anyone ... you don't have to worry about this. But if you
start a watch, it is your responsibility to know how big your watch file
is and to stop the watch when you no longer need it. The command
&G"watch size" &W tells you how many lines are in your watch file.
The command &G"watch clear"&W clears (deletes) your watch file.
For the time being the maximum number of lines you can display at one time
is 300. So ... even if you have 5,000 lines in your watch file ... you can
only display 1,000 at a time.

1 WEAPONS~
Weapons are the primary source of fighting power for most classes,
especially at lower levels where other skills and spells remain
unlearned. To use a weapon, simply 'wield <weapon name>'. You will
hit more frequently with a weapon which is suited to your class, so
choose your weapon wisely. For instance, mages use short blades at 95%
efficiency. A mage wielding a long blade would hit his/her target less
frequently, dependant upon the hitroll of the weapon in hand. Also, be
sure to practice and adept your favored weapontype for best results.
~

Wisdom is the prime attribute of druids and clerics.

~
31 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

WIZHELP provides a list of all the immortal commands.
~
31 WIZINVIS~
All immortals have the responsibility to be available to others whenever
possible, be they mortal or immortal.  When the use of wizinvis is called
for, the following are parameters for its use:

 - Immortals level 31 through 34 should be visible at all times, save
   for when snooping, running a quest or some similar circumstance.

 - Immortals level 35 and up may invis to any level at their discretion.

Guidelines for use of wizinvis by 35 and higher:
It is considered mandatory to be visible to all other immortals whenever
reasonably able to do so.  Using wizinvis beyond 31 to facilitate work on
a project, allow concentration on something, avoid excessive tells or the
like is fine, but it should only be used while necessary.

Guidelines for use of wizinvis beyond 31 in immortal channels:
Sightings of Someones in immortal channels should be kept to a minimum.
If you are free enough to be able to use an immortal channel, you should
be visible to the lowest immortal in that channel; no higher than 34 in
Muse, no higher than 31 in immtalk, etc.  Being a Someone to anyone on
an immortal channel should only occur if you're too tied up to go
visible but need to make a comment.

The same applies to all situations using channels, tells or actions.
Avoid being a Someone to mortals and immortals alike unless you have
a good reason to do otherwise.
