 As with many other muds and codebases, ELdhaMUD has very, very poor documentation,
 this is mostly because i have been lazy and because i have been teaching myself
 to code.
 
 I have tryed to contact most of the snippet authors for redistubution permission
 and to credit you for your work, if you feel you have been hard done by and that
 i have not followed your licience, or credited you in a way you feel happy with,
 then please feel free to contact me eldhamud@gmail.com and i will do whatever i
 can you fullfill your wishes.
 
 I will be offering minimal support via the forums at http://www.eldhamud.org
 I cannot say that i will be able to help, but i will try my best to do so.
 
 This code has bugs in it, make no mistake about it, there are bugs and it will
 crash from time to time, this is an older version of the code that i currently
 run. What i can say tho is the bugs are not hard to fix, you will get 4 odd days
 uptime befor a crash and the next release of this code will be much more stable.
 
 Oh and i can say this also, the next version will break many things and will not
 be very compatable with this version of eldhamud.
 
 Thank you,
